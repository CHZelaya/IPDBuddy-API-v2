## Project Overview

**IPD Buddy** is a personal project built to help a contractor friend reduce the amount of time doing administrative tasks after his work day, track material usage and get paid accurately for piecework in the Insulation, Poly, and Drywall trade. The system is designed to:
- Let contractors log materials used on jobs via a simple web form
- Automatically calculate their total pay
- Generate and email two PDF reports (one for the employer and one for personal record-keeping)
- Include personal financial breakdowns like taxes and savings recommendations based on financial literacy research

This repo contains the backend API built with Java Spring Boot.
